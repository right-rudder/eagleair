Instrument Rating Training                     

The Instrument Pilot Certificate allows a Private Pilot to fly through clouds and around weather. As a Part 141 School, we can finish your Instrument Rating in 35 hours. We are also permitted to complete 14 of those hours on our full-motion DCX-MAX simulator. Using the sim is a huge savings in time and money for our students. The rest of the hours are flown in a Cessna 172 G1000 aircraft. You will work with a CFII at our facility. Northwest Indiana weather usually gives you the opportunity to log some “actual” time. We can also do the Part 61 Instrument rating but do not advise it as there is so much more cross country time involved.

Commercial Flight Training

If you want to get paid to fly, this is your route. Commercial pilots must be at least 18 years old, or older. Part 141, they must have a minimum of 190 hours of flight time total (or 250 for Part 61). They must hold an IFR rating, or be restricted to only daylight operations, under visual flight rules (VFR), and operating within 50 miles from the originating airport. 

Medically, commercial pilots must have a Class II medical, which requires renewal every 12 months. Re-validation of pilot certificates must be every 24 months via a review from a certified flight instructor.

Multi-Engine Training

Train in our Beechcraft Baron 55 with 260hp per engine and a Garmin 430!

Our individualized training plan will fit your busy schedule. The average applicant will need about 8 hours of flight instruction and about 10 hours of ground instruction.

*Not taking out of school students at this time.

CFI Rating

Flight instructors are authorized to provide flight instruction to pilots and pilots requiring additional certificates/ratings. Flight Instructors also complete flight review for license re-validation and recommend flight tests for students. As a CFI, you must be at least 18 years of age, and hold a valid commercial pilot certificate & IFR rating.

Aside from their standard flight review every 24 months, CFI’s must also re-validate their instruction certification every 24 months. You may not instruct without a CFI rating.

Airline Transport Pilot

At the pinnacle of professional aviation is the Airline Transport Pilot certificate (ATP). As an ATP, you must be at least 23 years old and have completed a minimum of 1,500 hours of flight time. ATP’s must also possess an instrument rating and a commercial certificate.

You may bypass part of those requirements by completing an aviation degree through a university (like Liberty University). This is called an R-ATP (or restricted ATP). The requirements change, allowing you to be 21 years old with 1,000-1,250 hours of flight time depending on the type of degree.

ATP’s can hold a Class I medical, which requires renewal every six months, or a class II which requires renewal every year. Re-validation of certificates must be every 24 months via a flight review.  Due to recent changes by the FAA, all ATP candidates must take a separate training course for ATP with simulator training.  We still offer the Test here at Eagle.  We would be happy to talk with you about how to complete your ATPb

Private Pilot Rating
Private Pilot Certificate

Private pilots make up the vast majority of certified pilots. This is because it is the first rating you must complete in order to fly. A Private Pilot may carry passengers, but cannot fly for hire. In addition to this, Private pilots are not able to fly in weather (or what we call IFR conditions).

There are two types of ways you could obtain a Private Pilot License (PPL), either Part 61 or Part 141. For Part 61, you must complete a minimum of 40 hours of flight time (at least 20 hours instruction, and 10 hours solo). The more structured, accelerated Part 141 program allows you to complete your PPL in a minimum of 35 hours when you complete your training at an FAA Part 141 Certified Flight School (which Eagle Aircraft is). The requirements for becoming a Private Pilot for both programs are:

Be 17 years of age (or 16 to solo)
Read, speak, write and understand the English language
Hold a student pilot certificate (which you will receive on your first lesson)
Receive flight training and a logbook endorsement from an authorized instructor
Meet the aeronautical experience requirements for the aircraft rating sought
Pass a practical test for the aircraft rating sought
Complete a practical (flight) test given as a final exam by an FAA inspector or designated pilot examiner

Private Pilots must pass a Class III medical which must be renewed every 2 or 5 years, contingent upon age. In addition to this, your PPL must be validated every 24 months via a flight review with a certified flight instructor (CFI).

Instrument Rating
Instrument Pilot Certificate

Typically, after completing a Private Pilot’s course, the next step is the Instrument Rating. This permits the pilot to operate in more diverse weather conditions (reduced visibility like rain, haze, or low clouds). Essentially, the pilot is learning to fly the airplane strictly on instruments and without visual reference points, aside from takeoffs and landings. Any pilot flying above 18,000 ft (MSL), must have an instrument rating.

Instrument ratings need very specific training from certified flight instructors who have a designation allowing them to teach instrument flight (CFII), along with accuracy from additional oral, written, and flight tests. As a Part 141 School, we can finish your Instrument Rating in 35 hours. We are also permitted to complete 14 of those hours on our full-motion DCX-MAX simulator. Using the sim is a huge savings in time and money for our students. The rest of the hours are flown in a Cessna 172 G1000 aircraft. Northwest Indiana weather usually gives you the opportunity to log some “actual” time. We can also do the Part 61 Instrument rating but do not advise it as there is so much more cross country time involved.

A Certified Flight Instructor pilot needs to keep current by doing six approaches, a hold, and tracking and can do this affordably on Eagle Aircraft’s simulator every six months. Eagle also does IPC’s (Instrument Proficiency Check) on the simulator or in the aircraft if you have been out of currency for more than one year.

Flight Training
Instrument Rating Training                     

The Instrument Pilot Certificate allows a Private Pilot to fly through clouds and around weather. As a Part 141 School, we can finish your Instrument Rating in 35 hours. We are also permitted to complete 14 of those hours on our full-motion DCX-MAX simulator. Using the sim is a huge savings in time and money for our students. The rest of the hours are flown in a Cessna 172 G1000 aircraft. You will work with a CFII at our facility. Northwest Indiana weather usually gives you the opportunity to log some “actual” time. We can also do the Part 61 Instrument rating but do not advise it as there is so much more cross country time involved.

Commercial Flight Training

If you want to get paid to fly, this is your route. Commercial pilots must be at least 18 years old, or older. Part 141, they must have a minimum of 190 hours of flight time total (or 250 for Part 61). They must hold an IFR rating, or be restricted to only daylight operations, under visual flight rules (VFR), and operating within 50 miles from the originating airport. 

Medically, commercial pilots must have a Class II medical, which requires renewal every 12 months. Re-validation of pilot certificates must be every 24 months via a review from a certified flight instructor.

Multi-Engine Training

Train in our Beechcraft Baron 55 with 260hp per engine and a Garmin 430!

Our individualized training plan will fit your busy schedule. The average applicant will need about 8 hours of flight instruction and about 10 hours of ground instruction.

*Not taking out of school students at this time.

CFI Rating

Flight instructors are authorized to provide flight instruction to pilots and pilots requiring additional certificates/ratings. Flight Instructors also complete flight review for license re-validation and recommend flight tests for students. As a CFI, you must be at least 18 years of age, and hold a valid commercial pilot certificate & IFR rating.

Aside from their standard flight review every 24 months, CFI’s must also re-validate their instruction certification every 24 months. You may not instruct without a CFI rating.

Airline Transport Pilot

At the pinnacle of professional aviation is the Airline Transport Pilot certificate (ATP). As an ATP, you must be at least 23 years old and have completed a minimum of 1,500 hours of flight time. ATP’s must also possess an instrument rating and a commercial certificate.

You may bypass part of those requirements by completing an aviation degree through a university (like Liberty University). This is called an R-ATP (or restricted ATP). The requirements change, allowing you to be 21 years old with 1,000-1,250 hours of flight time depending on the type of degree.

ATP’s can hold a Class I medical, which requires renewal every six months, or a class II which requires renewal every year. Re-validation of certificates must be every 24 months via a flight review.  Due to recent changes by the FAA, all ATP candidates must take a separate training course for ATP with simulator training.  We still offer the Test here at Eagle.  We would be happy to talk with you about how to complete your ATPb
