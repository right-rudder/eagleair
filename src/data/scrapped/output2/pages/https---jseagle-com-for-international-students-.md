Application Guide for Candidates and Providers

The link below will help international students to fill out the necessary form to apply for flight training in the U.S. The fee is ($130.00 USD) and will need to be paid when the TSA sends a note to the student asking for payment. The student will also need to submit fingerprints when requested.

After students fill out the form, they should print a copy of ALL forms and payment records submitted to the TSA for their personal records.

Once approval is received, training must begin immediately as most of the training under the visa is good for only 365 days.

These are the steps that you will need to follow:

1. Start an account on the FTSP Flight Training Security Program website. You will need to create an account, and the FTSP will email you the user name and password.

3. Eagle Aircraft will receive a notification that you have applied and we will then confirm your application. The TSA will next contact you to pay the fee.
