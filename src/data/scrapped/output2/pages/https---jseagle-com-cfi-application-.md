About us

Eagle Aircraft offers a comprehensive flight training program which takes you from obtaining your Private through ATP flight training ratings.

Our staff of professional flight instructors has earned a reputation that brings individuals from all over the world just to attend our flight school for their training.

Eagle Aircraft is a Cessna Pilot Center. The Cessna program is the only integrated flight-training program in existence – flight and ground school lessons are designed by educational experts to work together for maximum retention. We are one of only eight FAA Part 141 flight schools in the state of Indiana.

We are also approved for VA benefits and SEVIS approved for International students. We welcome international students who want to come to the United States to train and will issue an I-20 to students who need an M-1 visa to begin flight training at our facility. Affordable housing will be arranged for our students.

Contact Eagle Aircraft at +1 (219)-464-0132 or email eaglevpz@gmail.com for more information about our international student program.
