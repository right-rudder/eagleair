Instrument Rating
Instrument Pilot Certificate

Typically, after completing a Private Pilot’s course, the next step is the Instrument Rating. This permits the pilot to operate in more diverse weather conditions (reduced visibility like rain, haze, or low clouds). Essentially, the pilot is learning to fly the airplane strictly on instruments and without visual reference points, aside from takeoffs and landings. Any pilot flying above 18,000 ft (MSL), must have an instrument rating.

Instrument ratings need very specific training from certified flight instructors who have a designation allowing them to teach instrument flight (CFII), along with accuracy from additional oral, written, and flight tests. As a Part 141 School, we can finish your Instrument Rating in 35 hours. We are also permitted to complete 14 of those hours on our full-motion DCX-MAX simulator. Using the sim is a huge savings in time and money for our students. The rest of the hours are flown in a Cessna 172 G1000 aircraft. Northwest Indiana weather usually gives you the opportunity to log some “actual” time. We can also do the Part 61 Instrument rating but do not advise it as there is so much more cross country time involved.

A Certified Flight Instructor pilot needs to keep current by doing six approaches, a hold, and tracking and can do this affordably on Eagle Aircraft’s simulator every six months. Eagle also does IPC’s (Instrument Proficiency Check) on the simulator or in the aircraft if you have been out of currency for more than one year.
