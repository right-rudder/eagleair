Private Pilot Rating
Private Pilot Certificate

Private pilots make up the vast majority of certified pilots. This is because it is the first rating you must complete in order to fly. A Private Pilot may carry passengers, but cannot fly for hire. In addition to this, Private pilots are not able to fly in weather (or what we call IFR conditions).

There are two types of ways you could obtain a Private Pilot License (PPL), either Part 61 or Part 141. For Part 61, you must complete a minimum of 40 hours of flight time (at least 20 hours instruction, and 10 hours solo). The more structured, accelerated Part 141 program allows you to complete your PPL in a minimum of 35 hours when you complete your training at an FAA Part 141 Certified Flight School (which Eagle Aircraft is). The requirements for becoming a Private Pilot for both programs are:

Be 17 years of age (or 16 to solo)
Read, speak, write and understand the English language
Hold a student pilot certificate (which you will receive on your first lesson)
Receive flight training and a logbook endorsement from an authorized instructor
Meet the aeronautical experience requirements for the aircraft rating sought
Pass a practical test for the aircraft rating sought
Complete a practical (flight) test given as a final exam by an FAA inspector or designated pilot examiner

Private Pilots must pass a Class III medical which must be renewed every 2 or 5 years, contingent upon age. In addition to this, your PPL must be validated every 24 months via a flight review with a certified flight instructor (CFI).
