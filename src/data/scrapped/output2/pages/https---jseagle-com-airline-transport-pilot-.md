Airline Transport Pilot

At the pinnacle of professional aviation is the Airline Transport Pilot certificate (ATP). As an ATP, you must be at least 23 years old and have completed a minimum of 1,500 hours of flight time. ATP’s must also possess an instrument rating and a commercial certificate.

You may bypass part of those requirements by completing an aviation degree through a university (like Liberty University). This is called an R-ATP (or restricted ATP). The requirements change, allowing you to be 21 years old with 1,000-1,250 hours of flight time depending on the type of degree.

ATP’s can hold a Class I medical, which requires renewal every six months, or a class II which requires renewal every year. Re-validation of certificates must be every 24 months via a flight review.  Due to recent changes by the FAA, all ATP candidates must take a separate training course for ATP with simulator training.  We still offer the Test here at Eagle.  We would be happy to talk with you about how to complete your ATP.
