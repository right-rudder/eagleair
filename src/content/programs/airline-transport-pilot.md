## Airline Transport Pilot Certificate — The Highest Level of Pilot Certification

The **Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) Certificate** represents the pinnacle of professional aviation. While **Eagle Aircraft** does not currently offer a formal ATP training program, we provide this information to help our students and alumni understand the requirements for transitioning into **airline and advanced commercial flight operations**.

This guide supports pilots understanding both **traditional ATP requirements** and those pursuing a **Restricted ATP (R-ATP)** through approved university pathways.

---

## What Is an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate?

An ATP certificate is required for pilots to serve as **Captain (Pilot in Command)** for:

- Part 121 airline operations
- Advanced charter and corporate flight departments
- High-level commercial aviation roles

To qualify, pilots must demonstrate **extensive flight experience, advanced aeronautical knowledge, and professional decision-making ability**.

## ATP & Restricted ATP (R-ATP) Eligibility

### Standard ATP Requirements

- **Minimum age:** 23
- **Total flight time:** 1,500 hours
- **Required certificates:**
  - Commercial Pilot Certificate
  - Instrument Rating
- **FAA knowledge test and practical test**
- **ATP Certification Training Program (CTP)** completion (required)

---

### Restricted ATP (R-ATP) Pathway

Pilots may qualify for a **Restricted ATP** with reduced flight-hour requirements by completing an approved aviation degree.

- **Minimum age:** 21
- **Flight time requirements:**
  - **1,000–1,250 hours**, depending on degree type
- **University partnerships supported**, providing a structured route for students
