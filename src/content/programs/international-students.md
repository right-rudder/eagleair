## TSA Flight Training Approval — Required for International Students

All international students seeking flight training in the United States must receive approval through the **TSA Flight Training Security Program (FTSP)**, also known as the **Alien Flight Student Program (AFSP)**.

This process is mandatory before beginning flight training and applies to students enrolling in **Private Pilot, Instrument Rating, and Multi-Engine training** at **Eagle Aircraft Flight Academy**.

## Overview of the FTSP / AFSP Process

The TSA conducts a background security assessment for international flight students. Once approved, students may begin training, but **training must start promptly**, as approval and visa eligibility are typically valid for **365 days**.

Students are responsible for submitting applications, fees, and fingerprints directly to the TSA, while Eagle Aircraft confirms enrollment as the training provider.
