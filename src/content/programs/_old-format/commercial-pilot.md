## Why Eagle Aircraft’s Commercial Program Stands Out

### Structured Part 141 Curriculum
Most of our students utilize the Part 141 path, which is the primary requirement for our university and international partners. This structured syllabus uses **Phase Checks** to gauge competency, ensuring you are hitting your marks at every step of the program.

### Realistic Professional Development
At Eagle Aircraft, we hire professional instructors who are building their own careers toward the airlines. By training here, you learn the real-world environment of a high-volume flight school. We have trained over **4,000 pilots** who have gone on to fly in all sectors of the industry.

### Complex Aircraft Proficiency
You’ll finish your training with real-world proficiency in **complex, high-performance aircraft**. This experience is vital when applying for your first commercial job in charter or cargo operations.

## Training Progression—Part 141 Phase Checks

Instead of loose stages, your training follows an FAA-approved syllabus with designated **Phase Checks** performed by our senior flight instructors.

### Phase 1: Complex Transition & Commercial Fundamentals
- Transitioning to retractable gear and constant-speed propeller systems.
- Mastering high-performance engine management.
- Initial introduction to commercial-level precision standards.
- **Milestone:** First Commercial Phase Check.

### Phase 2: Performance Maneuvers
- Mastering the "commercial maneuvers": Chandelles, Lazy Eights, and Eights-on-Pylons.
- Power-off 180-degree accuracy landings (the commercial standard).
- Steep spirals and emergency descent procedures.
- **Milestone:** Maneuver Proficiency Phase Check.

### Phase 3: Cross-Country & Night Operations
- Long-distance commercial cross-country flights.
- Advanced night navigation and airport operations.
- Focus on Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) and risk management.
- **Milestone:** Cross-Country Phase Check.

### Phase 4: Final Checkride Preparation
- Comprehensive review of all maneuvers to ACS standards.
- Mock oral exams covering commercial regulations and systems.
- **Outcome:** FAA Commercial Pilot Certificate.

## Who This Program Is For

### Career Pilots Building Toward Airlines
Commercial certification is the required step before moving into **Flight Instructor (CFI)** roles to build the time necessary to **meet ATP minimums**.
