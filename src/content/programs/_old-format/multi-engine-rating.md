## Who This Program Is For

### Aspiring Airline Pilots

A multi-engine rating is a non-negotiable requirement for reaching the airlines. Building multi-engine PIC (Pilot-in-Command) time is a key step in meeting ATP minimums.

### Commercial Career Paths

Part 135 charter and cargo operators rely heavily on multi-engine aircraft. This rating opens doors to corporate flight departments and light twin commercial operations.

### Future Multi-Engine Instructors

The rating is the prerequisite for the **[Multi-Engine Instructor (MEI)](/programs/multi-engine-instructor)** certificate, which is one of the most valuable credentials an instructor can hold.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does the rating take?** **A:** Most students complete the rating in **7–10 days** of focused training, depending on weather and student proficiency.
