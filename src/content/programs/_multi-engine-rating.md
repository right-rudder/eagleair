  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  upperheader: "Common Questions"
  qnas:
    - question: "How long does the rating take?"
      answer: "Most students complete the rating in 7–10 days of focused training, depending on weather and student proficiency."
    - question: "Do I need an instrument rating first?"
      answer: "It is not legally required, but highly recommended. If you do not have an instrument rating, your multi-engine privileges will be restricted to VFR only."
    - question: "What is the 'critical engine'?"
      answer: "Our Beechcraft Baron features conventional rotation, meaning it does have a critical engine (the left engine). Mastering the aerodynamics of this is a core part of the training."
    - question: "Can I use the simulator?"
      answer: "Yes. Our Elite G1000 AATD simulator is an excellent tool for familiarizing yourself with multi-engine procedures and Garmin avionics before your first flight, saving you time and money."
