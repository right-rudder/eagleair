The 1500-hour rule requires pilots to log a minimum of 1,500 flight hours before flying for most U.S. airlines as a first officer.

## Why the Rule Exists

The rule was implemented to improve safety by ensuring pilots have sufficient real-world experience before airline operations.

## What Counts Toward the 1500 Hours?

- Flight instruction
- Cross-country time
- Instrument and night flying
- Commercial and multi-engine time

## How Students Build Time

Many pilots become flight instructors or fly charter and cargo operations to build hours efficiently.

Understanding this rule early helps students plan their training and career progression realistically.
