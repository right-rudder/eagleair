“In the soup” is a term pilots use to describe flying in clouds or weather conditions with no outside visual reference.

## Why It Matters

When pilots are in the soup, they rely entirely on flight instruments rather than visual cues.

## Instrument Training

Learning to fly safely in these conditions is a key part of earning an Instrument Rating.

## Real-World Application

Airline and commercial pilots operate in instrument conditions regularly, making this training essential for professional aviation.

Instrument proficiency is a cornerstone of safe, confident flying.
