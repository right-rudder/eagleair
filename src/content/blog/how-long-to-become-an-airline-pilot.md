The time it takes to become an airline pilot depends on your training pace, program structure, and career goals.

## Typical Training Timeline

- Private Pilot Certificate: 3–6 months
- Instrument Rating: 2–3 months
- Commercial Pilot Certificate: 4–6 months
- Flight Instructing or Time Building: 12–24 months

## Accelerated vs Part-Time Training

Students in accelerated programs often reach airline minimums years sooner than part-time students.

## Realistic Expectations

Most full-time students can reach airline eligibility in 2–3 years, while part-time training may take 5+ years.

Choosing the right training environment is one of the most important decisions in your aviation career.
