Yes—some airline pilots do earn over $300,000 per year, but it doesn’t happen overnight.

## How Pilot Pay Works

Pay is based on:

- Aircraft type
- Years of service
- Airline contract
- Monthly flight hours

## Career Progression

First officers earn less initially, while senior captains on wide-body aircraft earn the highest salaries.

## Long-Term Outlook

With industry demand increasing, pilot compensation has risen significantly in recent years.

Aviation rewards commitment, consistency, and long-term career planning.
