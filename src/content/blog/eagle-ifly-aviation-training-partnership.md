Becoming an airline pilot has never been a local journey.

Today’s aviation careers are global—training, experience, and opportunity often span **multiple countries, airspaces, and regulatory systems**. That’s why choosing the right training partners matters as much as choosing the right aircraft or instructor.

We’re proud to announce a new strategic partnership between **Eagle Aircraft Flight Academy** and **iFly Aviation Group**, designed to create a **clear, structured, and accelerated pathway** for international pilots pursuing professional careers in aviation.

This partnership is built around one goal:  
**helping pilots reach airline readiness faster—with clarity, structure, and purpose.**

- Inconsistent career planning

By aligning Eagle Aircraft Flight Academy and iFly Aviation Group, this partnership removes friction and replaces it with **a defined progression from foundational training to advanced, airline-focused flight experience**.

This is not just cooperation—it’s **integration**.

Flight hours alone don’t make airline pilots.

Professional pilots are built through:
