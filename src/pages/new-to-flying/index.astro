      description: `<b>Your first time at the controls — no experience required.</b>
        A Discovery Flight is the perfect introduction to aviation. Fly with an Eagle Aircraft instructor, enjoy the view of Northwest Indiana and the lakeshore, and experience what it feels like to actually fly an airplane. It’s also a great gift for friends or family who dream of flying.
        
        What to expect: Safety briefing, preflight inspection, hands-on flying time, and a memorable first takeoff and landing.`,

      title: "Obtain Your FAA Medical",
      description: `<b>Make sure you’re cleared to fly before training accelerates.</b>
        Before solo flight, every pilot must hold an FAA medical certificate. Most students begin with a Third-Class medical, while career-focused pilots will later need a Second or First-Class. Getting this done early ensures a smooth, stress-free training experience.
        
        What to expect: Medical history review, vision and hearing checks, and a basic physical exam with an FAA-approved AME.`,

Eagle Aircraft’s accelerated Part 141 program helps you finish faster and more affordably, combining aircraft training, simulator time, and focused ground instruction.
        
        What to expect: One-on-one instruction, modern Cessna aircraft, simulator training, progress checks, and a clear roadmap toward your aviation goals.`,

            After earning your advanced ratings and building flight time, the final destination is the airlines. Eagle Aircraft helps you prepare for this transition by developing strong aeronautical decision-making, real-world IFR experience, and professional standards that airlines expect. Many pilots build their hours as CFIs, then move on to regional and major airlines with confidence.
            
            What to expect: Time building toward ATP minimums, airline-focused procedures, interview readiness, and a clear path from flight school to the cockpit of an airliner.`,
